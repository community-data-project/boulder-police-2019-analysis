	abstract = {Recent studies by police departments and researchers conﬁrm that police stop racial and ethnic minority citizens more often than whites, relative to their proportions in the population. However, it has been argued that stop rates more accurately reﬂect rates of crimes committed by each ethnic group, or that stop rates reﬂect elevated rates in speciﬁc social areas such as neighborhoods or precincts. Most of the research on stop rates and police-citizen interactions has focused on traﬃc stops, and analyses of pedestrian stops are rare. In this paper, we analyze data from 125,000 pedestrian stops by the New York Police Department over a ﬁfteen-month period. We disaggregate stops by police precinct, and compare stop rates by racial and ethnic group controlling for previous race-speciﬁc arrest rates. We use hierarchical multilevel models to adjust for precinct-level variability, thus directly addressing the question of geographic heterogeneity that arises in the analysis of pedestrian stops. We ﬁnd that persons of African and Hispanic descent were stopped more frequently than whites, even after controlling for precinct variability and race-speciﬁc estimates of crime participation.},

The matrix elements can have different variances and be correlated with each other. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. The results have implications for the dynamics of neural and other biological networks where plasticity induces correlations in the connection strengths within the network. We find that the presence of correlations can have a major impact on network stability.},

	abstract = {As part of the response to allegations of racially biased police practices many police agencies began collecting information on the stops made by their officers. Social scientists have attempted to use these administrative data on stop decisions to assess the existence or extent of racially biased policing and, in the process, have developed a number of benchmarks for comparison to police stop data. This chapter describes an array of benchmarking methods that have been used around the country including the use of U.S. Census population estimates, non-at fault driver crash data, crime and arrest data, drivers’ license data, red light cameras, observations, instrumental variables, assessments of post-stop outcomes, and officer-to-officer comparison via internal benchmarks. Each method’s application, strengths, and weaknesses are discussed in the context of their ability to establish a reasonable estimate of the population at risk for being stopped by the police and to draw a causal inference about the extent to which race is a relevant factor in police decision-making on whom to stop, question, and search.},
